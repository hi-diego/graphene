# About Graphene

Graphene is a minimalist .NET Core application framework inspired by Laravel, that merges the best of API-REST and GraphQL, using a Data-First approach and Non-Functional-Requirements philosophy.

We believe that web development must focus more on solving business problems than web technical issues, so Graphene provides a very simple, minimalistic, and generic basis to start working on your business logic.

Graphene takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- Automatic API (https://graphene.software.freedom.icu/docs/authentication).
- Automatic UI Generation (https://graphene.software.freedom.icu/docs/authentication).
- Authentication (https://graphene.software.freedom.icu/docs/authentication).
- Authorization [including DynamicAuthorization](https://graphene.software.freedom.icu/docs/authorization).
- Automation [including DynamicAutomation](https://graphene.software.freedom.icu/docs/automation).
- Model Events (https://graphene.software.freedom.icu/docs/model-events).
- Querying [including DynamicQuerying](https://graphene.software.freedom.icu/docs/querying).

Graphene is simple, minimalistic, and powerful Framework that provides the tools required to build small and simple applications, quickly.

## Learning Graphene

Graphene is built in a Test-Driven Development and Documentation-First approach, meaning that we first create the docs/tests and then the code, so we have effective [documentation](https://graphene.software.freedom.icu/docs).
